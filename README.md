In this project, I implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices 🏡 based on features like square footage 📐, number of bedrooms 🛏️, and bathrooms 🚿. First, I imported necessary libraries like pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical calculations, and sklearn for model building and evaluation 🔧. I loaded the training and test datasets, processed them to fill missing values using the median 📊, and selected key features (GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, and HalfBath) to predict the target variable, SalePrice 💰. Next, I split the data into training and validation sets, trained the model using the LinearRegression model, and evaluated its performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) 📉. Afterward, I used the trained model to predict house prices for the test dataset and saved the results in a CSV file 📄. Finally, I visualized the relationship between square footage (GrLivArea) and SalePrice using a scatter plot, where actual prices were shown as blue dots 🔵 and predicted prices as red dots 🔴. The final outcome included a validation RMSE for model accuracy, a submission.csv file with predicted prices, and a visual representation of how well the model fit the data! 🎉
